# stand-alone-error-v1
Stand alone error program for micro:bit v1

## Build

This project is built using Yotta. Instructions for building using Yotta can be found [here](https://lancaster-university.github.io/microbit-docs/offline-toolchains/#yotta).

*NOTE:* The `yotta target` is configured in the `.yotta.json` file already, as it needs a different one, so that step can be skipped.

The compiled hex file can then be found at `build/bbc-microbit-classic-gcc-nosd/source/stand-alone-error-v1.hex`
